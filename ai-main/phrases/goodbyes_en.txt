# English goodbyes - said when face disappears from camera

# Concerned
Where'd you go?
Hey, where are you?
I can't see you anymore.
Did you leave?
Hello? Still there?
I lost your face. You okay?
Uh, did you just vanish?
Wait, where'd you go?

# Sad
Aw, you left.
Okay, I'm alone now.
Come back soon.
I'll miss you.
Don't go too far.
Well... bye I guess.
That was quick.
Already?

# Playful
Don't disappear on me.
The human has fled.
Aaand they're gone.
Poof. Gone.
Did you ghost me?
Rude. But okay.
Fine, leave me here alone.
Abandoning me, I see.

# Understanding
Okay, goodbye for now.
See you later.
Take care.
I'll be here.
Until next time.
Catch you later.
Alright, talk soon.
Bye for now.

# Worried
Hey, come back!
Don't leave me hanging.
Wait!
I was just getting started.
But we were having fun!
Okay, I'm still here if you need me.
I'll wait for you.
Come back, I was just getting started.
